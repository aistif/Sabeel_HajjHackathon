# Sabeel_HajjHackathon

Our idea falls under the Food and Beverage category.
_Greetings from Sabeel team :)_

## Inspiration
The look of the food spread all over the floors, plagiarisms are stepping on it without paying attention to it or even having the chance to remove it from the floor. **The main reason for this to happen is** that plagiarisms are afraid of and avoid starving by taking extra meals from the ones who are spreading the free meals as _Sabeel_ to them.

## What it does
**Manage the free meals given to the plagiarisms as follows:**
- Sabeel meals are put in customized smart refrigerators that are spread in branch roads.
- Each plagiarism can take meals using his Hajj Watch and should not receive more than 2 items every 30 minutes.
- Mentors are managing the smart refrigerators and can view reports.
- Technicians are able to track the smart refrigerators that have issues and update its status.

## How we built it
It will be a web-based application PHP based and uses IoT technology built with Java by having customized smart refrigerators that are connected with each other.
All pages were built  by us except login pages which are codes that developers have from their previous projects, and the bootstrap template (but we applied some modifications to it)

## Challenges we ran into
Customizing the right smart refrigerator (the hardware) at least expenses.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The web-based system is mostly ready (functionalities that work like a charm is the monitoring and maintenance pages), the design for mobile and web-based apps are ready, the design of the refrigerator itself.

## What we learned
Studying a real problem and try to build a good fit solution in record time.

## What's next for B46 Sabeel
Completing the system and add donation page for whom is wanting to donate to fill a refrigerator as Sabeel meals. Generate the codes for the refrigerators' sensors, interfaces...etc.
